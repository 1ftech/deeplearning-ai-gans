# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization by DeepLearning.AI

This repository contains coursework, projects, and key learnings from the **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization** offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera.

## üìö About the Specialization

The GANs Specialization teaches how to build and apply GANs‚Äîa class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks contest with each other. You‚Äôll learn to create and train GANs from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, explore common challenges in training, and apply GANs to real-world tasks such as image generation and style transfer.
